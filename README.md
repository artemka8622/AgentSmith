AgentSmith
==========

Agent Smith is C# code style validation plugin for ReSharper (Visual Studio plugin). 

The original home is https://code.google.com/p/agentsmithplugin/ however after the site is gone to readonly I continue my work under https://github.com/sheitmann/AgentSmith

Current version can be obtained from https://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/packages/ReSharper.AgentSmith/ or via the extension manager of R# 9.

If you find any bugs or would like to see improvements please open an issue on the github page.

Source code will be uploaded soon, after it was cleaned up a bit.

AgentSmith
==========

Agent Smith is C# code style validation plugin for ReSharper (Visual Studio plugin). 

The original home was google code and you can find the archived project under https://code.google.com/archive/p/agentsmithplugin/ .

I started to work on AgentSmith when ReSharper 7 Beta was released, to update it and keep it working on the latest ReSharper versions.

Current and future version can be obtained from https://resharper-plugins.jetbrains.com/packages/ReSharper.AgentSmith/ or via the extension manager of ReSharper.

If you find any bugs or would like to see improvements, please open an issue on the github page.
I will try my best to fix them or add improvements but they will take some time because this is just a hobby project.

Source code will be uploaded soon, after it was cleaned up a bit.
